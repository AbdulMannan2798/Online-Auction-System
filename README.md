# Online-Auction-System
The online auctioning system is a flexible solution for the lot-based auctions. This report explains the construction of an auctioning website. The system has been designed to be highly-capable of supporting a large number of bidders in an active auction. This online auction system lets you easily browse lots and place bids using a secure server. All cost of mailing the lots of auction have to pay by the buyer. The objective is to develop a user friendly auctioning website where any kind of product can be auctioned and provide value added services to the bidders and the sellers. The products will be authenticated and the site provides a safe environment for online users. This project has two parts- customer interface and admin interface. Customer Panel permits a customer to upload a product for sale and bid on a particular product to buy. This system presents an online display of category wised products they want to sell or bid. There is an admin panel by which an admin can control the whole bidding system. Admin can approve products by the categories and also can control the registered customers. There is fixed delivery policy. After finishing the bidding process there is a notify system to notify the sellers and bidders. This is a fully dynamic system which can be easily operated by the users.
